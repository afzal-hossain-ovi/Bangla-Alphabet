# Bangla-Alphabet

#Description
---
I am specially interested to develop mobile application for the kids. In this app, kids will learn ka-kha bangla letters. Each letter will be shown with a simple word. There is also a feature to test the kids whether they have learned the alphabets or not. Another interesting feature of this app is that the kids can draw anything in this app. More precisely, it has been designed to practice writing the letters.
we have also included voice for each letters and words.
